   abstract = {The accurate identification of dinosaur egg accumulations as nests or clutches is crucial for understanding the reproductive behaviour of these extinct species. However, existing methods often rely on the presence of complete eggs and embryo remains, and sedimentological criteria that are only applicable to well-structured sediments. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to characterize egg accumulations in structureless sediments, where traditional nest structures may not be preserved. Our methodology employs a unique combination of sedimentological, taphonomic, geochemical, and geophysical proxies for the study of egg accumulations. We applied this approach to the egg accumulation from Paimogo (Jurassic, Portugal), traditionally interpreted as a nest. Our findings reveal that the Paimogo egg assemblage is a secondary deposit, resulting from a flooding event in a fluvial plain that dismantled several allosauroid and crocodylomorph clutches. The eggshell vapor conductance results, coupled with sedimentological evidence, suggest that allosauroid dinosaurs buried their eggs in the dry terrain of overbank areas close to a main channel during the breeding season, likely during the dry season to prevent the embryos from drowning. This research underscores the necessity of multidisciplinary approaches in interpreting egg accumulations and offers a novel methodology for studying these accumulations in structureless sediments. Our findings provide new insights into the breeding behaviour and nesting preferences of these extinct organisms, contributing to our understanding of dinosaur ecology.},

   abstract = {Chatbots are increasingly finding their way into e-commerce and e-services, as their implementation opens up promising opportunities to improve customer service. The present paper examines chatbots in this context, elaborating on their functional aspects that are rapidly leading to significant improvements in service quality. First, based on a literature review of recent publications in this field, an overview of their key features and functionalities underlining the relevance of chatbots for customer service is provided. Second, a further contribution is made by introducing two categories of chatbots' objectives based on their functional dedication, i.e. "improvement of service performance" and "fulfillment of customer's expectations". The considered chatbots' customer-related functions are interaction, entertainment, problem-solving, trendiness, and customization. The chatbot categories are discussed in detail. Their positive influence on service quality, constituting the chatbots' functional goal, as well as the potential of chatbots in customer service are pointed out.},

This technology started in the 1960’s; the aim was to see if chatbot systems could fool users that they were real humans. However, chatbot systems are not only built to mimic human conversation, and entertain users. In this paper, we investigate other applications where chatbots could be useful such as education, information retrival, business, and e-commerce. A range of chatbots with useful applications, including several based on the ALICE/AIML architecture, are presented in this paper.},

   abstract = {AI chatbots have ignited discussions and controversies about their impact on teaching and learning practices in higher education. This study explores students' adoption and perceptions of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots in higher education. Based on survey data from a large sample (n = 5894) across Swedish universities, the study employs descriptive statistical methods to analyze usage, attitudes, and concerns, and inferential statistics to identify relations between attitudes and usage and background variables (gender, academic level, and field of study). The results reveal broad awareness and use of ChatGPT among students, but not of other AI chatbots. More than half of the students expressed positive attitudes towards the use of chatbots in education, but almost as many expressed concerns about future use. Statistically significant differences were found across all examined grouping variables, particularly between genders and fields of study. Female students and students from the humanities and medicine consistently expressed more negative attitudes and concerns about AI's role in learning and assessment, while males and technology and engineering students showed higher usage and optimism. These findings not only validate the continued relevance of student backgrounds as a determinant of technology adoption but also expose several challenges and considerations surrounding AI and chatbot usage in education. The study supports the development of local solutions to AI in education tailored to student attributes and needs, and it provides insights for developers, educators, and policymakers.},

We take a three-pronged approach to the empirical data. We first examine the state of the emerging field of AI chatbots in HE. Second, we identify the theories of learning used in the empirical studies on AI chatbots in HE. Third, we scrutinise the discourses of AI in HE framing the latest empirical work on AI chatbots. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the eclectic state of the nascent research area of AI chatbots in HE, the lack of common conceptual groundings about human learning, and the presence of both dystopian and utopian discourses about the future role of AI chatbots in HE.},

AI chatbots can provide immediate support by answering questions, offering explanations, and providing additional resources. Chatbots can also act as virtual teaching assistants, supporting educators through various means. In this paper, we try to understand the full benefits of AI chatbots in education, their opportunities, challenges, potential limitations, concerns, and prospects of using AI chatbots in educational settings. We conducted an extensive search across various academic databases, and after applying specific predefined criteria, we selected a final set of 67 relevant studies for review. The research findings emphasize the numerous benefits of integrating AI chatbots in education, as seen from both students' and educators' perspectives. We found that students primarily gain from AI-powered chatbots in three key areas: homework and study assistance, a personalized learning experience, and the development of various skills. For educators, the main advantages are the time-saving assistance and improved pedagogy. However, our research also emphasizes significant challenges and critical factors that educators need to handle diligently. These include concerns related to AI applications such as reliability, accuracy, and ethical considerations.},
